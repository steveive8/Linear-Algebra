# Lec 1. The Geometry of Linear Eqautions

## Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang. MIT Lecture 2005 Spring

## Edited By Steve Ive
This article is based on Gilbert Strang's lecture script. The article will be described according to the flow of the lecture.

What's in the first lecture? The fundamental problem of linear algebra, which is to solve a system of linear equations. So Let's start with a case when we have some numbers of equations, say **n equations and n unknowns**. So the equal number of equations and unknowns. That's the normal nice case. And what I want to do is with examples, of course to describe, first, what I call the **Row picture**. That's the picture of one equation at a time. It's the picture you'be seen before in two by two equations where lines meet. So in a minute, you'll see lines meeting. 

The second picture, I'll put a star beside that, because that's such an important one. And maybe new to you is the picture -- a column at a time, the **Column Picture**. And those are the rows and columns of a matrix.

So the third -- the algebra way to look at the problem is the **matrix form** and using a matrix that I'll call A.

The core of the thing is that we will see through problem with the new sight of **Column Picture** which is the ***linear combination*** of the columns of matrix.

### The Things we are going to cover this lecture

#### The pictures of how to see the problem.

- Row Picture

- **Column Picture**

- Matrix Form

#### Can I solve Ax = b for every b? 
(every b means the all the bs in three dimentional space)

- Singular, non-Singular

#### The way of matrix mulitplication

- Row picture: The Dot Product

- Column Picture: **The Linear Combination**.


So, let's take an example.
