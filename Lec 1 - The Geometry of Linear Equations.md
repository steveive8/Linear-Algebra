### Row Pictures, Matrix Form, and the *Column Picture

The fundamental problem of Linear Algebra, which is to solve a system of linear equations.

So let's start with a case when we have some number of equations, say

- n equations
- n unkowns

So an equal number of equations and unknowns. That's the normal, nice case.

What I want to do is to describe, first what I call the **Row Picture**.

---

### Row Picture

It's a picture of one equation at a time. It's the picture you've seen before in two by two equations where lines meet. So, in a minuite, you'll see lines meeting.

### *Columnn Picture

The second picture, I'll put a star beside that, because that's such an important one. And maybe new to you is the picture, **a column at a time**. And those are the rows and columns of a matrix. 

### Matrix Form

So the third, the algebra way to look at the problem is the matrix form an using a matrix that I'll call A.

---

So let's go with an example.

#### Two eqautions, two unknowns.

> 2x - y = 0

> -x + 2y = 3

What's the matrix, that is what's the coefficient matrix of upon?

The matrix that involves those numbers, a matrix is ***just a rectangular array of numbers.*** Here it's two rows and two columns, so 2 and -1 in the first row, -1 and 2 in the second row, that's the matrix.
