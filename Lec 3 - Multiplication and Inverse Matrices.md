 # Multiplication and Inverse Matrices

 ## Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang. MIT Lecture 2005 Spring

 ## Edited By Steve Ive

 We've been multilplying matrices already, we're gonna discuss the rules for matrix multiplication. The interesting part is there are many ways we can do it, and they all give the same answers and they are all important.

 ### Things we are going to cover this lecture

 - Matrix Multiplication

 - Inverses

 ## Matrix Multiplication

 We'll begin with how to multiply two matrices. Suppose that we have a matrix A, multiplying a matrix B and giving us a result a matrix C.

 $\matrix{1|⋯|⋮|⋰|1|⋯|1|⋮|1}$
